6. **ChatGPT**: In CSS, the `max()` function is used to set a maximum value for a property. It can be applied to various CSS properties such as width, height, font-size, and more.

Here is an example of how to use the `max()` function in CSS:

```css
.container {
  width: max(300px, 50%);
  /* The width will be set to 300px or 50% (whichever is smaller) */
}

.text {
  font-size: max(16px, 1.5em);
  /* The font-size will be set to 16px or 1.5em (whichever is smaller) */
}

.box {
  height: max(200px, 30vh);
  /* The height will be set to 200px or 30vh (whichever is smaller) */
}
```

In these examples, the `max()` function is used to set a maximum value for each respective property. It takes two or more arguments and returns the smaller value among them.

So, in the first example, if the container has enough space, it will have a width of 50% of its parent or simply 300px if that is smaller. The second example sets the font-size to either 16px or 1.5em (depending on which is smaller), and the third example sets the height to either 200px or 30vh (viewport height) if the latter is smaller.

Remember to check browser compatibility for the `max()` function, as it might not be supported in all versions of all browsers.
